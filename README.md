# Word_2_Wine
## This project uses natural language processing techniques to help answer questions the average consumer might have about a wine bottle or variety at their favorite wine store or the wine list at a restaurant. 

## Below are some of the areas I explored on this project: 
- Analysis of high rated vs. low rated wines to see what words describe them.
- Which wine varieties are similar to each other?
- Keynotes that describe each type of wine variety
- What words are associated with each other in the subject or language of wine?
- Are there some wine varieties that have a more positive sentiment from wine critics, and are there some that tend to have a negative sentiment?

### The data was sourced from a Kaggle dataset that scrapped over 130,000 reviews from Wine Enthusiast magazine.
